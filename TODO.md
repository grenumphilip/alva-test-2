In this task, you will work with the [Chicago Crime Dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/city-of-chicago-public-data/chicago-crime) to figure out some insights regarding the crimes commited in Chicago.

Here are some examples of the columns you will work with:

|Variable|Description|
|----:|-----|
|primary_type |What type of crime was committed|
|location_description |Description of the location where the crime was committed|
|arrest|If the crime led to an arrest or not|

Feel free to explore the dataset and try out different queries using the BigQuery interface.
Once you have a query that answers the question, add the code snippet to the specific question as well any supportive reasoning/comment that you may have.  

## Task 1 

From what date is the oldest data point in the data set? 

> TODO: Your answer

## Task 2

Which year had the largest amount of crimes and how many crimes were committed that year?

> TODO: Your answer

## Task 3

Let's define "Arrest Rate" as the share of crimes that led to an arrest.
What were the five most common crimes in 2020? Which of those has the highest and lowest arrest rate?

> TODO: Your answer

## Task 4

What year had the highest arrest rate? Plot the number of crimes per year and comment on the trend.

> TODO: Your answer

## Task 5

Which year had the most number of crimes leading to an arrest? How many arrests were made during that year? Plot the trend for total number of arrests per year.

> TODO: Your answer

## Task 6

How has the arrest rate looked like over time? 
- Plot the trend of the arrest rate.
- Between which years can you see the biggest change in "Arrest Rate"?
- Can you point at specific reasons to why the Arrest Rate dropped between those years? Comment on your conclusions.

> Since the data set is constantly updating, disregard the year 2021 and later for the analysis in this question.
